Simple CTF is a beginner level room on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). It has few questions that
guide you in which steps have to be done. Here's my walkthrough on solving that
machine.

## Enumeration

First, as always, I started enumerating the system. Here is the output of this
nmap command:

``` bash
nmap -sCV <ip-address>
```

![nmap](/public/img/simpleCTF/nmap.png)

With this information I could answer the first two questions.

- How many services are running under port 1000?
> Answer: `2`
- What is running on the higher port?
> Answer: `ssh`

It has the port 80 open, so I typed the ip in my browser and it displayed the
default's apache page. I run **gobuster** to find hidden directories in order to
get more clues.

``` bash
gobuster dir -u http://<ip-address> -x -.txt,.php,.html -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 64 -q
```

After fuzzing I found a the `/simple` directory, which seems potencially
vulnerable. When I browsed it showed the interface of a CMS called *made
simple*, and the version of the service was 2.2.8.

## Vulnerability assessment

I went to [exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) and search
for exploits for this service. There's one for that version, and I could
answer the next question:

![exploitDB](/public/img/simpleCTF/exploitDB.png)

- What's the CVE you're using against the application?
> Answer: `CVE-2019-9053`
- To what kind of vulnerability is the application vulnerable?
> Answer: `SQLi`

This exploit is the `46635.py` and I tried to run it with this command:

``` bash
python /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/46635.py -u http://<ip-address>/simple --crack -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best110.txt
```

With the parameter `--crack` it also outputs the password of the user. The
wordlist I normally use for cracking passwords is the `rockyou.txt` as is the
most complete one, but in this case there was a hint in the room recommending to
use the `best110.txt`, which would make the process shorter.

![exploit](/public/img/simpleCTF/exploit.png)

At this point I could answer the next two questions:

- What's the password?
> Answer: `******`
- Where can you login with the details obtained?
> Answer: `ssh`

## Gaining access

The credentials found by the exploit allow to ssh into the machine, so there was
no need to do anything with the ftp service that was also running.

``` bash
ssh -p 2222 mitch@<ip-address>
```

Being in the machine i was able to answer the next two questions, read the
`user.txt` file and find another user with home directory.

- What's the user flag?
> Answer: `cat user.txt`
- Is there any other user in the home directory? What's its name?
> Answer: `sunbath`

## Privilege escalation

In order to escalate privileges I tried with `sudo -l` and found that was
possible to run vim as root without the password. That's an easy one, so in vim
as root I executed the command `:!sh` and immediately had a root shell. I could
read the root flag and answer the last questions to complete the room.

![ssh](/public/img/simpleCTF/root.png)

- What can you leverage to spawn a privileged shell?
> Answer: `vim`
- What's the root flag?
> Answer: `cat root.txt`

## Alternatives

Another way to solve this room would have been looking into the ftp server.
There's a file that shows that there's another user called mitch, and it was
possible to get its password using **Hydra**:

``` bash
hydra -l mitch -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt <ip-address> -s 2222 -t 4 ssh
```
